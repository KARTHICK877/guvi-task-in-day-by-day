write a blog on the different between document &window object?
answer:

According to the current web page context, the window object represents the browser window where your document is displayed.
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window. 
The window object has many useful properties like the location object and the setTimeout function.
The document holds a model representation of the currently loaded document (such as title, anchors, etc). 
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.
